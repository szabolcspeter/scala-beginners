# Scala essentials
### Hi Folks!<br/>

### Hope you have a good day! :-)<br/>
I've just decided to learn Scala and functional programming in general.<br/>
As they say, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step :-)<br/>  
I uploaded small demo programs for my own learning purposes.<br/>
This content is based on this Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/rock-the-jvm-scala-for-beginners

Scala is cool but requires time to learn :-)
